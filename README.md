# Mark.js-playground

### Description
The program can handle `mark.js` or `jquery.mark.js` - it only requires adding according reference in `Playground.html` file.
It works both with new [https://github.com/angezid/mark.js](https://github.com/angezid/mark.js) and existing library. The existing library has many limitations, so behavior of this program will depend on mark.js library.  
Note: the files ending with `.es6.js` in my fork `mark.js/master/dist` folder are ES6 module, they won't work with this program.  
Due to limitations of the existing library, the next/previous buttons functionality with `acrossElements` option may not work as expected. The same in 'Ranges' tab.

The mark.js package v8.11.1 is installed as a default.

#### The Codejar editor issue
On local machine, using modules will only complicate things - it will be required of using server.  
The package of a code editor `codejar` don't contain `umd` format, currently the `codejar.js` is converted to this format by `replace-in-file` plugin (`rollup` failed to do this).

### Install Mark.js-playground
Clone or download this repository and run:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

### Export/Import
The idea to export/import 'Playground tab' in JSON format:
* save/load the current state
* bug report
* ask for help, if there's problem highlighting something

Note: be reasonable, do not export big HTML test content, due to security reason, nobody will dare to import your export (only who trust you).  
Locate and leave only problematic place(s) which can be easily visually examine.  

### Things you need to know

There are two test content editors - Text and Html . If you want to add a HTML content, you need to switch to the Html editor.

An `object` option was added to the Accuracy selector, just to enable an `accuracy` editor. This option is not part of the mark.js library.

If some code is added to the `filter` or/and `each` callbacks, the program evaluate the whole internal code (see 'Internal code' which appears below the 'Results').  
Otherwise, only the option that accept Objects, Arrays or RegExp are evaluated.

For the internal code, there are 6 variable `a - f` declared, just in case.  
The generated code for all other than default option is in the 'Generated code'.

Warning: currently there is no protection on unsaved state on the browser reload or on load from local storage.  
You may accidentally click the Load button and silently overwrite the current state by a previously saved one.
